      "The Root Mean Squared Loss (RMSE) is a common loss function used in regression problems. Here's a general outline of how you might implement RMSE in Python:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Import necessary libraries**: You will need libraries like NumPy for numerical operations and possibly scikit-learn or TensorFlow for their implementation of the loss function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Define the RMSE function**: The RMSE is calculated by taking the square root of the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted values and actual values. \n",
      "\n",
      "   - Calculate the difference between each pair of predicted and actual values.\n",
      "   - Square these differences.\n",
      "   - Find the average (mean) of these squared differences.\n",
      "   - Take the square root of this average.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use Python to compute RMSE**: You can implement these steps in a Python function, which might take as arguments the true values and predicted values for each sample or data point.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Test your implementation**: Plug in some test data to verify that your function is working correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I would recommend using scikit-learn's `mean_squared_error` function, which calculates RMSE by default:\n",

      "# Predicted values and actual values for some samples\n",
      "y_pred = [1, 2, 3]\n",
      "y_true = [0.9, 1.8, 3]\n",
      "\n",
      "rmse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)\n",
